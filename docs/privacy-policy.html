    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: June 15, 2026</p>

    <p>Rotation TrackerStats ("the App") is developed by StackStats Apps LLC ("we", "our", "us"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.</strong> All data you enter into the App — including rotation patterns, rotation blocks, notes, travel details, and settings — is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.</p>

    <h2>Calendar Access</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may write your rotation schedule to Apple Calendar (EventKit). This data is exchanged directly between the App and Apple Calendar on your device. We never have access to your calendar data.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may send local notifications to remind you of upcoming rotation changes. These notifications are generated entirely on your device. No data is sent to any server to deliver notifications.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional subscriptions managed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or process any payment information. All subscription transactions are handled by Apple. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how Apple handles your purchase data.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. We do not collect usage data, crash reports, or device information.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose your data to any third parties. Period.</p>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>The App provides features to export your rotation schedule to Apple Calendar. These exports are generated locally on your device using the standard iOS calendar integration. We do not receive copies of your exported data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
