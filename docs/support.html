    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I set up my rotation pattern?</strong>
        <p>Open the app and go to Patterns. Tap the "+" button to create a new pattern. Enter the number of days on and days off (e.g., 28 on / 14 off), set your start date, and tap Save. Your calendar will automatically populate with color-coded rotation blocks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What rotation patterns are supported?</strong>
        <p>Any pattern you need! Common ones include 4/2 (4 weeks on, 2 off), 2/2, 14/14, 28/14, 7/7, and more. You define the number of days on and days off — the app handles the rest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Is my data private?</strong>
        <p>Yes. All your data is stored locally on your device. We don't have servers, we don't collect your data, and we never sell anything to anyone. Your schedule, notes, and travel details stay on your iPhone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How does the countdown work?</strong>
        <p>The countdown automatically calculates how many days remain in your current rotation block — whether you're on or off. It updates daily so you always know exactly when your next transition is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Can I export my schedule to Apple Calendar?</strong>
        <p>Yes! Go to your rotation pattern and use the export option. The app will create calendar events for your on/off blocks in Apple Calendar. You'll need to grant calendar permission when prompted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I add travel details?</strong>
        <p>Open any rotation block and tap "Travel Details." You can add flight numbers, hotel bookings, confirmation codes, departure times, and notes. Everything stays attached to that specific rotation block for easy reference.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Can I get reminders before my rotation changes?</strong>
        <p>Yes! Enable notifications in the app settings. You can choose how far in advance you want to be reminded — 1 day, 3 days, or a week before your next transition. The app will send you a local notification so you can prepare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I cancel my subscription?</strong>
        <p>Go to Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions on your iPhone, find Rotation TrackerStats, and tap Cancel Subscription. You'll keep Pro access until the end of your current billing period.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>I'm not seeing my subscription / features are locked</strong>
        <p>Try these steps: (1) Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID you used to subscribe. (2) Open the app settings and tap "Restore Purchases." (3) Restart the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What happens if I delete the app?</strong>
        <p>Your data is stored locally, so deleting the app will remove your data. We recommend exporting your schedule to Apple Calendar before uninstalling so you don't lose your rotation dates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Can I change my rotation pattern mid-schedule?</strong>
        <p>Yes. You can edit your existing pattern or create a new one with a different start date. Your historical rotation blocks are preserved, and the new pattern applies going forward.</p>
